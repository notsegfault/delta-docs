The Ethereum bonus rewards of our referral program can be claimed from our site, in the Delta Referral Program section:

Go to [Delta Finance](https://www.delta.finance/) and click on the black "Connect Wallet" button.

Choose Metamask or WalletConnect to complete the process.



### Claim your Bonus <a href="#claim-your-bonus" id="claim-your-bonus"></a>

After connecting your wallet, you can claim your bonus by clicking on the "CLAIM BONUS" button. Your bonuses will be transferred to your wallet after the transaction has been confirmed.

## **rLP Referral Bonus Rewards** <a href="#rlp-bonus" id="rlp-bonus"></a>

The rLP bonus rewards from the LSW referral program can be claimed on our site.

If you have referral rLP tokens and you did not contribute to the LSW from that account, you have to first register your address using the Fixer contract. Otherwise you can skip to the [following step](https://web.archive.org/web/20210921212023/https://docs.delta.financial/guides/claim-referral-bonus#claimbonusrlp).
