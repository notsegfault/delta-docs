On the main page click on **Vaults** to open the Deep Farming Vault page.

Navigate to the Vault actions section of the vault making sure that "**Stake DELTA**" has been selected. Enter the amount of Delta you would like to stake or click "**MAX**". Depending on your type of deposit you can check or uncheck the "**Burn Deposit"** option. Make sure to read about [Burn Deposits](../deep-farming-vault.md#burn-deposit) before selecting this option.

Afterwards click the "**Stake"** button and confirm your transaction.

Give it a few minutes until the Balances section reflects your newly staked tokens.
